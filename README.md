🌟 Introduction

This project contains two Tableau visualizations that I worked on as part of my learning: one is based on the Titanic dataset, and the other is from the Coffee Chain business dataset.

The main idea was to understand how to use Tableau for exploring data, creating charts, and getting insights in a simple and visual way. What I liked the most was seeing how the graphs immediately showed patterns that are not easy to catch by just looking at raw data.

TITANIC DATASET VISUALIZATION 📁 About the Dataset
The Titanic dataset includes details about passengers—like their age, gender, class, ticket fare, and whether they survived or not. Using this, I tried to understand the factors that influenced survival on the ship.

🧭 What I Did in Tableau

Here is what I created step by step:

A bar chart to see how many male and female passengers were on board.

A stacked bar chart showing survival count for males vs females.

A bar chart comparing survival rate across different passenger classes.

A histogram to see the age distribution.

A scatter plot comparing age and fare to find patterns.

A box plot to show fare differences between passenger classes.

A heat map showing survival rate grouped by both gender and class.

A pie chart of male vs female passenger proportions.

A dashboard combining all these visuals into one interactive page.

COFFEE CHAIN DATASET VISUALIZATION 📁 About the Dataset
The Coffee Chain dataset is more business-oriented. It includes information about different coffee products, states, sales, profit, marketing spend, and more.

My goal here was to analyze how different products and regions performed and identify where the company is doing well and where it is not.

🧭 Tasks I Completed

I used Tableau to answer several questions. Some of the main tasks were:

Creating a heat map to compare profit across states and product types.

Making a box plot to check how Espresso products differed in sales.

Building a bar chart to see which products and categories bring in more profit.

Using a scatter plot to compare sales and profit for each state.

Finding the highest and lowest profit states.

Checking the sales of Decaf Espresso in Nevada.

Calculating the percentage of total profit contributed by Tea.

Finding the average marketing spend in specific area codes.

Comparing products in California to see best and worst performers.

Identifying the minimum marketing value for Colombian Coffee Beans.

Calculating Decaf’s contribution to sales in the East market overall and in 2012.

Finding average profit for all products whose names start with “C”.

Checking the Top 5 products in the Central region by sales.

Finding the best profit state in West market for 2013.

Identifying the lowest-profit state’s expense-to-sales ratio.

Counting distinct area codes in low-margin small markets.

Finding the profit percentage for Caffe Mocha in Major Market (2013).

Checking in which month and year Decaf sales crossed $1,100 in Colorado and Florida.

Creating a tree map to see which market had the highest budgeted sales.
